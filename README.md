# Brooklyn College Parking Finder App

This project is a class assignment aimed at addressing the recurring parking issues around Brooklyn College campus. Often, students and faculty members spend considerable time searching for parking spaces, leading to inefficiency and frustration. The goal of this app is to provide a solution by displaying a satellite image of the parking spaces on campus. Users can conveniently reserve a parking spot, check the availability of free spots, and identify reserved areas to streamline the process of finding parking.

## Getting Started with Brooklyn Parking Finder

Before running the application, make sure to install the required dependencies. In the project directory, run:

```bash
npm i
```
## Available Scripts

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the following scripts:

### `npm start`

Launches the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page will reload when you make changes, and any lint errors will be displayed in the console.

### `npm test`

Initiates the test runner in interactive watch mode. For more information on running tests, refer to the [testing documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production in the `build` folder, optimizing it for the best performance. The build is minified, and filenames include hashes. Your app is now ready to be deployed. Refer to the [deployment documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for further information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!**

If you're dissatisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command copies all configuration files and transitive dependencies directly into your project, providing full control. Be cautious, as this is an irreversible operation.
